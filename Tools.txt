Maven Scopes

compile => Default scope. Dependencies will be added during complie time.

test => Dependencies will be added to project path during unit test.

runtime => Dependencies will be added to project during runtime.

provided => will add at compile time not at runtime.Means we will add the dependencies at compile time why because we need at the compile time but at run time that will be added or taken care 
                     care by container or server.

Staging area : Staging is an activity where we are selecting only those images which we want now as a backup.



==>Git Architectur
*******************


Git Architecture Components

(A) Working Directory (Working Tree)

	What it is:
		The actual files and folders you are working on — your project in its editable state.

	Key point:
		This is where you add, modify, or delete files.

	Command examples:

		git status → shows modified/untracked files.

		git diff → shows changes compared to last commit.

(B) Staging Area (Index)

	What it is:
		A temporary holding area where you list the changes you want to commit.

	Purpose:
		Lets you prepare commits in a controlled way — you can commit only selected changes.

	Command examples:

		git add file.txt → moves file to staging area.

		git reset file.txt → removes file from staging.

(C) Local Repository (.git folder)

	What it is:
		The hidden .git folder in your project.
		Contains all commits, tags, branches, and Git history for this repo.

	Purpose:
		Permanent storage of your code history in your machine.

	Command examples:

		git commit -m "message" → saves staged changes here.

		git log → shows commit history.

(D) Remote Repository (e.g., GitHub)

           What it is:
              A copy of your repository stored on a server (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.).

          Purpose:
	      Enables collaboration & backup.

	 Command examples:

		git push origin main → sends commits to remote.c

		git pull → brings new commits from remote.


==> README.md

  	md file is a file that we are creating in github for introducing what work we have done,what this project is all about ,what modules are present in this project, what all features are present 	in this project we can add all these in md file.


==>git remote add origin <url> (grao)
      
	why am i using this command is because after running this command it adds the remote/central repo url into my config file of local repo . By adding that url into local repo config file I am 	telling now whatever  code that i have it in my local repo  now this config file says whenever I will do a git push my code will go to this url and via this url  my code will push to git hub.

==>To delete file from central repo
	 
	git rm <file_name>
	git commit -m "msg"
	git push
