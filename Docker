->Docker provides portability and compatibility to our application to run on different differenet platforms(platform = software + hardware).
->Setting up and updating environment is easy with docker.
->In traditional process we need to set up our environment required to run our application in each and every server.In that might also chance of getting a chance of compatibility issue why because we develope our code
  in windows machine but we deploy our code in linux machine which create compatibility issues.To over come from this we started using docker where we use centralized configuration.
