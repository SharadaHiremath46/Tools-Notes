AGILE
#############################################
->Agile is a methodology that helps us to build the software quickly in least possible time without compromising with the quality of work.
->In agile we get the requirement like user stories.
->Team size in agile is 6-9.


Agile Terminologies
***************************
1.User Stories : User requirements.Every uses story consists of business value points.

2.Product Backlog: It consists of all user stories which needs to be develope.(All users stories are kept in one place which is called as product backlog).It will also holds defects(testing team will pass)

3.Sprint Backlog: 
-> Important stories are pick up and kept in the place called as sprint backlog.
-> It consists of user stories which will be develope now or immidiate.
-> All the stories kept here should be such that we can develop it within 2-4 weeks.

4.Business Analyst: Collects all user stories.

5.Product Owner:He will have super duper domain knowledge.He should have minimum 25yrs of experience.All business analysts are works under him.Product Owner helps tester,developer etc to understand how features should work.
-> He is a domain expert.
-> He maintain product backlog.
-> He also ideally conducts sprint planning

6.Scrum Master: Scrum Master is like manager but manager is authoritative(boss) , scrum master is facilitator.

7.Spring team : Scrum team consists of Scrum master+developer+tester.
->Scrum team size should always be 6-9.
->There will be several scrum team in the project.Workdone by the individual scrum team after the review will be integrated with the features developed by other teams in integration server. And then we once again test how will they are integrated.

8.Sprint duration :2-4 weeks.

9.Sprint planning : This meeting happens between Product owner+developers+testers. In this meeting we do the following
1.Understanding user stories.
2.Estimation: It should be small duration (max duration 2 weeks to 4 weeks why because if time is short we will be more focused).

10. Sprint : It is the duration within which a working software is developed.
-> Sprint duration always be between 2-4 weeks.

(How to give values to user activities)
11. Planning Poker activity :This activity happens in Backlog grooming.
-> It is a meeting that happens between business analyst and product owner to give the business value points(points to user stories).
-> To give business value points we use poker cards.
-> This classification helps us to decide which user story should be develope first.
->Card numbers are given based on fibonacci series.

NOTE : 1. If the work not completed within the sprint duration then we blowup the sprint and again start with new sprint and new estimation.
       2. A project will have several scrum teams.
       3.People committed in the projects are called as pigs.Example developers,testors,scrum masters,product owner etc.
       4.The one who is not committed in the project in agile is called as hen. Examples managers,vp(vice president or senior manager) in it etc.
       5.In standup meetings only pigs are supposed to talk while hen can only attend the meeting but shouldn't talk during meeting.

12. KANBAN chart :To maintain transperancy in agile among team members we prepare kanban chart.6

13.Backlog Grooming: 







Responsibilities of Scrum master
*****************************************
1.Scrum master should generate burn down chart to analyse progress of work.We can also make use of burn up chart but it is not that popular in industry.
2.He should conduct daily standup meeting.(Standup meeting goes on 15 min).
3.He should remove the obstacles encountered by the team.
4.He should promote scrum values.




Steps in agile software development to develop software:
**********************************************************
1. Collect user stories.
2. Business analyst will collect user stories and will give the points to the user stories to classify user stories based on importanc. 
3. Then user stories are kept into Product Backlog and which will handover to Product Owner he will handles product backlog further.
4. From product backlog pickup only those user stories which can be develope maximum in 4 weeks and minimum in 2  weeks
5. PickedUp user stories are put into srint backlog(which consists of user stories which I will build at now).
6. After sprint backlog I cann't develop software directly I should understand user stories. To understand user stories meeting happens between Product Owner,Testers,Developers.
7. After discussion developers and testers should give the estimation to product owner.
8.After that developers will start developin and after development it will go for review if review is success then software will transfer to integration.


Advantages of Agile:
********************************
1.Helps us to build the software quickly.
2.Transperancy among team members.(Who is doing what)
3.Better communication among team members.
4.Gives assurance of quality software.


Disadvanages of Agile:
******************************
1.Manager looses his authority.
2.We require little bit of experience to work in this process.



Drawbacks of SDLC(Software Development life cycle) :
**********************************
1.Not clear requirement gathering.
2.Managers are authoritative.
3.Employee management is difficult because of large team size.
4. Tracking of an employee is difficult who is working and who is not.



Expected Questions on Agile:
**********************************
1.What is the sprint duration in Agile?
-> 2-4 weeks.
  sub question: What if the work is not completed within 2-4 weeks or promised time?
              ->Blowing up the sprint.(

2. What is the ideal team size or Scrum team size in Agile?
-> 6-9

3. Who all involved in scrum team?
-> Scrum masters + Developers + Testers.

4. What were you doing in sprint planning?
-> Understanding user stories and doing estimation.

5. What is sprint backlog?
-> It consists of user stories which will be develope now or immidiate.

6. What is product backlog?
-> Consists of complete user stories(all collected).

7. What all meetings were you attending in your company?What used to happening in the meeting?

8.Tell me if your user story point is 3 how many days it will take for you to fix?
->In my company for user story point 3 they had allocated one day.For user story point 5 it was given 2 days.If user story point is 8 then it's 8 days.If user story point is 0 then it is 0.5 days.The number of days required for me to basically build that story should be decided in backlog grooming/meeting.
