AGILE
#############################################
->Agile is a methodology that helps us to build the software quickly in least possible time without compromising with the quality of work.
->In agile we get the requirement like user stories.
->Team size in agile is 6-9.


Agile Terminologies
***************************
1.User Stories : User requirements.

2.Product Backlog: All users stories are kept in one place which is called as product backlog.

3.Sprint Backlog: Important stories are pick up and kept in the place called as sprint backlog.It consists of user stories which will be develope now or immidiate.

4.Business Analyst: Collects all user stories.

5.Product Owner:He will have super duper domain knowledge.He should have minimum 25yrs of experience.All business analysts are works under him.Product Owner helps tester,developer etc to understand how features should work.

6.Scrum Master: Scrum Master is like manager but manager is authoritative(boss) , scrum master is facilitator.

7.Spring team : Scrum master+developer+tester.

8.Sprint duration :2-4 weeks.




Sprint Planning:
*****************************
1.Understanding user stories.
2.Estimation: It should be small duration (max duration 2 weeks to 4 weeks why because if time is short we will be more focused).


Steps in agile software development to develop software:
**********************************************************
1. Collect user stories.
2. Business analyst will collect user stories and will give the points to the user stories to classify user stories based on importanc. 
3. Then user stories are kept into Product Backlog and which will handover to Product Owner he will handles product backlog further.
4. From product backlog pickup only those user stories which can be develope maximum in 4 weeks and minimum in 2  weeks
5. PickedUp user stories are put into srint backlog(which consists of user stories which I will build at now).
6. After sprint backlog I cann't develop software directly I should understand user stories. To understand user stories meeting happens between Product Owner,Testers,Developers.
7. After discussion developers and testers should give the estimation to product owner.



Drawbacks of SDLC(Software Development life cycle) :
**********************************
1.Not clear requirement gathering.
2.Managers are authoritative.
3.Employee management is difficult because of large team size.
4. Tracking of an employee is difficult who is working and who is not.

-> 2-4 weeks.

2. What is the ideal team size or Scrum team size in Agile?
-> 6-9

3. Who all involved in scrum team?
-> Scrum masters + Developers + Testers.

4. What were you doing in sprint planning?
-> Understanding user stories and doing estimation.

5. What is sprint backlog?
-> It consists of user stories which will be develope now or immidiate.

6. What is product backlog?
-> Consists of complete user stories(all collected).
